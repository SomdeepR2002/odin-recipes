    <h1>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter. My advice? Do it perfectly.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti: This recipe, which makes about four servings, starts with one pound of uncooked spaghetti. </li>
        <li>Oil: You’ll need ½ cup of olive oil. </li>
        <li>Garlic: Six cloves of thinly sliced garlic lends bold flavor. </li>
        <li>Seasonings: This traditional spaghetti aglio e olio is flavored with crushed red pepper flakes, black pepper, and fresh parsley. </li>
        <li>Cheese: For the most delicious results, grate your own Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese instead of opting for the pre-shredded stuff.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to make</h2>
    <p>You’ll find the full, step-by-step recipe below – but here’s a brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade spaghetti aglio e olio: </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the spaghetti. </li>
        <li>Toast the garlic in olive oil. </li>
        <li>Stir the seasonings into the pasta, then stir in the garlic and oil. </li>
        <li>Toss with cheese. </li>
    </ol>
